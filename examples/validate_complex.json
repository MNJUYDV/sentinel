  "answer": "Based on the retrieved documents, there are conflicting policies regarding SSN storage. The current security policy (2024-03-15) states that SSNs must not be stored in plaintext and must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. However, there is a legacy policy from 2020 that allows plaintext storage in restricted internal systems. The current policy should take precedence as it is more recent. Additionally, the encryption standards document specifies that all data at rest must use AES-256 encryption with proper key management, and encryption keys must be rotated every 90 days.",
